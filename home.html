				The chart below shows the number of registrations and market share of plug-in vehicles each month over the past 13
				months. Due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, sales of all vehicles were hit from mid-March. However,
				electric vehicles were affected less than other vehicle types, as can be seen by the anomalous market share in
				April.
				<br />
				<br />
				Electric vehicle registrations continue to rise in absolute numbers, with 24,537 new registrations in October 2021
				(16,155 BEVs and 8,382 PHEVs). The market share last month was 23.1%. Note that, in the UK, March and September are
				new registration plate months, which accounts for the twice-yearly peaks in sales and drop in market share in these
				periods.

						Although the purchase price of an EV is normally higher than the purchase price of fuel cars, the time has come

						The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of an EV is lower, according to the

							>report</a

						from the International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT). The report studied the cost factors of owning a VW Golf
						in five separate European countries - Norway, Germany, France, United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Despite the
						fact that only a VW Golf is included in this research, it signals the start of the EV revolution in Europe.
					</p>
					<p>
						The study examined the purchase, fuel and tax costs of the VW Golf in four different versions:
						<a target="_blank" href="https://newmotion.com/en_GB/charging-a-volkswagen-golf-gte">fully electric</a>, plug-in

						Over a period of four years, fully electric cars were the cheapest in all five countries because of tax reduction,
						cheaper fuel costs and subsidies on purchase prices. In particular, the rise of the EV industry and the lower
						costs of owning one have been stimulated through government grants and tax reductions. InsideEVs, Jalopnik and
						Oilprice confirm ICCT’s report with their own findings on how Electric Vehicles are cheaper compared to non-EVs.
					</p>
					<p>
						In general, the EV charging cost is significantly lower compared to fuel costs for petrol cars. Jalopnik
						calculated that you can save more than €1,200 per year on fuel costs
						<a target="_blank" href="https://newmotion.com/en_GB/charging-a-tesla-model-3">driving a Tesla Model 3</a>
						Performance instead of an Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. Not only is regular fuel more expensive, but hydrogen
						cars also lose to EVs with respect to fueling costs, according to Oilprice. Coming from water, hydrogen seems to
						be a cheaper fuel. However, it requires an additional external source to split the H2O molecules into hydrogen and
						oxygen. This process is not developed in an optimal way and therefore results in a more expensive fuel.

					<h3 id="norwayandthebenefitofdrivingelectric">Norway and the benefit of driving electric</h3>
					<p>
						Besides fuel costs, tax reductions take a great part in the lower TCO for Electric cars. For example, InsideEVs
						shows that the rest of the world can learn from Norway’s tax system. Indeed,
						<a target="_blank" href="https://newmotion.com/en_GB/norway-is-leading-ev-owning-country-in-the-world"
							>Norway is currently leading</a
						>
						the way to e-mobility in Europe. EV drivers benefit from tax savings, which results in a lower purchase price and
						a lower overall TCO. This tax system stimulates Norwegians to drive electric and will eventually bring the
						government a step closer to reach their sustainability targets.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another Norwegian government policy is the bonus payment scheme for high-emission vehicles. The Netherlands is
						also using this policy to encourage people to drive electric, to expand the EV charging point network and help
						businesses to adopt e-fleet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fortunately, more and more European countries have made financial incentives available to promote the EV and
						charging stations, such as the
						<a target="_blank" href="https://newmotion.com/en_GB/the-office-of-low-emission-vehicles-olev-grant">OLEV grant</a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In short, petrol fuelled cars are not the cheapest options anymore and neither are hydrogen cars: EVs are taking
						over the market.

					<h3>Are electric cars better for the environment?</h3>
					<p>
						The major benefit of electric cars is the contribution that they can make towards improving air quality in towns
						and cities. With no tailpipe, pure electric cars produce no carbon dioxide emissions when driving. This reduces
						air pollution considerably.
					</p>
					<p>
						Put simply, electric cars give us&nbsp;cleaner streets&nbsp;making our towns and cities a better place to be for
						pedestrians and cyclists. In over a year, just
						<a href="https://co2.myclimate.org/" target="_blank"
							>one electric car on the roads can&nbsp;save an average 1.5 million grams of&nbsp;CO2</a
						>. That’s the equivalent of four return flights from London to Barcelona.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Electric cars and UK's Net Zero target</h3>
					<p>
						According to the
						<a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/shorthand/cleaner_vehicles/" target="_blank"
							>Mayor of London, road transport accounts for around half of the capital's air pollution</a
						>. It’s no wonder that the UK government and local councils want to accelerate the number of electric cars on the
						roads. The UK government has set a target that the&nbsp;sale of petrol and diesel cars will be banned by 2040. The
						government is also looking to&nbsp;reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2050, and electric cars will play a big role
						in that.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
						What's more, EVs can also help with noise pollution, especially in cities where speeds are generally low. As
						electric cars are far quieter than conventional vehicles, driving electric creates a more peaceful environment for
						us all.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Compare an electric vs petrol car</h3>
					<p>
						The&nbsp;Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology&nbsp;has put a fabulous&nbsp;tool together to help you<a
							href="https://www.list.lu"
							target="_blank"
						>
							compare the overall environmental impact&nbsp;of electric cars vs internal combustion engine (petrol) cars</a
						>. The main aim is to let users understand why, how, and in which cases electro-mobility is actually performing
						according to its green image, by cutting per-km emissions from its fossil fuel-based counterpart. A second
						objective is to show in which conditions electric vehicles may "counter-perform": what happens when the battery
						size changes;&nbsp;or the background electricity mix;&nbsp;the battery lifetime;&nbsp;what about winter conditions
						affecting battery performances?
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>How does electric car production affect the environment?&nbsp;</h3>
					<p>
						Making electric cars does use a lot of energy. Even after taking battery manufacture into account, electric cars
						are still a greener option.&nbsp;This is because of&nbsp;the reduction in emissions created over the car’s
						lifetime
					</p>
					<p>
						The emissions created during the production of an electric car tend to be higher than a conventional car. This is
						due to the manufacture of lithium ion batteries which are an essential part of an electric car.&nbsp;<a
							href="https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EV-life-cycle-GHG_ICCT-Briefing_09022018_vF.pdf"
							target="_blank"
							>More than a third of the lifetime CO2 emissions from an electric car come from the energy used to make the car
							itself</a
						>. As technology advances, this is changing for the better.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.edfenergy.com/electric-cars/batteries"
							>Reusing and recycling batteries is also a growing market</a
						>.&nbsp;Research into the use of second-hand batteries is looking at ways to reuse batteries in new technologies
						such as electricity storage.&nbsp;One day we could all have batteries in our homes being used to store our own
						energy. Opportunities like this will reduce the lifetime environmental impact of battery manufacture.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>What about the electricity required to fuel an electric car?&nbsp;</h3>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/electric-vehicles-from-life-cycle" target="_blank"
							>Research by the European Energy Agency&nbsp;</a
						>found that, even with electricity generation, the carbon emissions of an electric car are around 17 – 30% lower
						than driving a petrol or diesel car. The emissions from electricity generation are also dramatically improved when
						low carbon electricity is used.
					</p>
					<p>
						That’s good news for our customers.&nbsp;Here at EDF we produce more low-carbon electricity than any other
						supplier&nbsp;in the UK<a href="#footnote-generation-electric" title="Generation Electric ">(1)</a>.&nbsp;The<a
							href="https://www.edfenergy.com/electric-cars/tariffs"
							>&nbsp;GoElectric tariff&nbsp;is also generated from 100% renewable sources</a
						>, helping electric car drivers to make more informed choices about how they charge up, maximising their
						environmental impact whilst&nbsp;driving.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>Are hybrid cars just as good for the environment?</h3>
					<p>
						Plug-in hybrids combine an electric motor with a traditional fuel engine and produce some emissions during a
						drive.
					</p>
					<p>
						The green credentials of a hybrid depend on how much of the journey is driven on electric miles as well as the way
						in which the vehicle is charged.&nbsp; This is why it's important for hybrid drivers to consider how their
						electricity is generated.&nbsp;Choose a form of
						<a href="https://www.edfenergy.com/electric-cars/tariffs">renewable energy, like the&nbsp;GoElectric tariff</a>,
						and you’re making your contribution to reducing emissions.
					</p>
					<p>
						All this shows that electric vehicles have a big role to play in reducing transport emissions and being a major
						factor in cleaning up the air we breathe.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
